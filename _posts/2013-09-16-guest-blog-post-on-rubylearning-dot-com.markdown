[Satish Talim](http://satishtalim.com/) of [RubyLearning](http://rubylearning.com/) 
recently invited me to write a guest blog post on my [GoogCurrency](https://rubygems.org/gems/goog_currency) gem
and using it in a Sinatra app. Thank you Satish!

[Part 1](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2013/09/04/sinatra-and-google-currency-api-part-1/) deals with a developing a small Google Currency API library
test driven way.

In [Part 2](http://rubylearning.com/blog/2013/09/13/sinatra-and-google-currency-api-part-2/) we use the lib in a small Sinatra app.
